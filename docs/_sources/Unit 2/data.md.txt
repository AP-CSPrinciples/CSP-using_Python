# Data

Absolutely! Here's a **hands-on project** that aligns with **Big Idea 2: Data** from AP Computer Science Principles. It focuses on data collection, transformation, analysis, and visualization‚Äîkey concepts in this area.

## üß† **Project: "Data Detectives ‚Äì Investigating Real-World Trends"**

üéØ **Objective**

Students will investigate a real-world issue using data. They'll collect or access a dataset, clean and organize the data, analyze it, and present their findings with visualizations and a written explanation.

üß© **Big Idea 2 Concepts**

* **Data Acquisition**: Students obtain or access a dataset (e.g., from open data portals or surveys).
* **Data Representation**: Students convert raw data into usable formats.
* **Data Analysis**: Students filter, sort, and compute statistics to identify patterns or trends.
* **Visualization**: Students create graphs or infographics to communicate insights clearly.

---

üìã **Project Steps**

1. **Pick a Topic (in pairs or solo)**

Students choose a topic of interest such as:

* Climate change
* COVID-19 statistics
* Music or movie popularity
* Social media usage
* Sports performance

2. **Find or Collect Data**

Sources can include:

* [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
* [Google Trends](https://trends.google.com/)
* [Data.gov](https://www.data.gov/)
* Survey data from peers (e.g., favorite apps, screen time, etc.)

3. **Prepare the Data**

* Convert data to CSV or use Google Sheets
* Remove duplicates, deal with missing data
* Reformat columns if needed (e.g., converting strings to numbers)

4. **Analyze the Data**

* Identify interesting questions like:

  * What trend is increasing the fastest?
  * Is there a correlation between two variables?
* Use basic stats: mean, median, mode, max, min, percentages

5. **Create Visualizations**

Use tools like:

* Google Sheets
* Python (pandas + matplotlib or seaborn)
* Tableau Public
* Canva or Infogram (for infographics)

6. **Present Your Findings**

Deliverables:

* A chart or graph (at least one)
* A technical written explanation interpreting the data
* A short presentation or recorded video
