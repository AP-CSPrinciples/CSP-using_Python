---

**Objectives**

Students will be able to:

* Understand the binary number system (base-2)
* Convert decimal numbers to binary (and vice versa)
* Understand how text is represented in binary using ASCII
* Write a Python program to convert text into binary

---

**Introduction**


> What is the smallest piece of data a computer can understand?
> 
> Why do you think this computer engineers used this idea?
>  


**Binary Exploration**

> How many combination of numbers can we make using just one bit?
> 
> Each bit will double the number of possible values.
> 

| Bits | Possible Values |
| ---- | --------------- |
| 1    | 2               |
| 2    | 4               |
| 3    | 8               |
| 8    | 256             |

**Part 1: Binary Number System**

**1. Decimal vs. Binary**


Decimal (base-10) are made using place values (ones, tens, hundreds...).

Binary (base-2) uses **powers of 2**.

| bit 1 | bit 2 | bit 3 | bit 4 | bit 5 | bit 6 | bit 7 | bit 8 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 128 | 64 | 32 | 16 | 8 | 4 | 2 | 1 |
|  1  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 |

The binary number of `130` is `10000010`.

| Binary | Power of 2 | Value |
| ------ | ---------- | ----- |
| 1      | 2⁰         | 1     |
| 0      | 2¹         | 0     |
| 1      | 2²         | 4     |
| 1      | 2³         | 8     |
| Total  |            | 13    |

**Example: 1101 = 8 + 4 + 0 + 1 = 13**



**2. Activity: Convert Decimal ↔ Binary**

**Practice converting the following:**

* Decimal to binary: 5, 10, 23
* Binary to decimal: 101, 1110, 10011

**Part 2: How Text Becomes Binary**

**1. ASCII Encoding**

Explain that each character (like “A” or “!”) has a number assigned by ASCII.

| Character | ASCII Code | Binary   |
| --------- | ---------- | -------- |
| A         | 65         | 01000001 |
| a         | 97         | 01100001 |
| !         | 33         | 00100001 |

In Python you can type: `ord('A')` and `chr(65)` to see the conversion.

**2. Activity: Binary Message***

Use the handout to practice binary and ASCII.

---

**Part 3: Programming - Convert Text to Binary**


**Objective:**

* Takes a message as input
* Converts each character to its ASCII number
* Converts that number to 8-bit binary
* Displays the final binary string

---


**Step 1: Create the function**

Start by creating a function that takes **one input (a string message)**.

```python
def text_to_binary(message):
```

---

**Step 2: Make an empty list to hold binary codes**

Inside the function, make an empty list to save binary versions of each character.

```python
    binary_list = []
```

---

**Step 3: Loop through each letter in the message**

Use a `for` loop to go through each character in the message one by one.

```python
    for char in message:
```

---

**Step 4: Convert the character to ASCII code**

Use the `ord()` function to get the ASCII number for that character.

```python
        ascii_number = ord(char)
```

---

**Step 5: Convert the ASCII number to binary (8 digits)**

Use the `format()` function to change the number into **8-digit binary**.

```python
        binary_code = format(ascii_number, '08b')
```

---

**Step 6: Add the binary code to the list**

Now add the binary version to the list you created earlier.

```python
        binary_list.append(binary_code)
```

---

**Step 7: Join the binary codes into one string**

Once the loop is done, combine everything into one string, with a **space between each binary number**.

```python
    final_binary = ' '.join(binary_list)
```

---

**Step 8: Return the final binary string**

Return the complete string from the function.

```python
    return final_binary
```

---

**Step 9: Call the function and show the result**

Try it out with a message like `"Hello, World!"` and print the result.

```python
result = text_to_binary("Hello, World!")
print(result)
```

---

**Example Output:**

```python
01001000 01100101 01101100 01101100 01101111 00101100 00100000 01010111 01101111 01110010 01101100 01100100 00100001
```


---

**Extensions (Optional)**

* Encode and decode secret messages
* Create a visual binary art project using black/white squares

---

**Part 4: Programming - Convert Binary to Text**

**Learning Objectives**

Students will be able to:

1. Explain how binary represents ASCII characters.
2. Convert binary strings into integers using `int(binary, 2)`.
3. Translate integers into ASCII characters with `chr()`.

---

> **Recall:**
> * **Binary**: Base-2 number system (only `0` and `1`).
> * **ASCII**: Each character has a decimal code (e.g., `A = 65`, `a = 97`).
> * Computers store text as binary numbers corresponding to these ASCII values.

**Example:**

* Letter `A` → Decimal `65` → Binary `01000001`.

---

**Step 1: Understanding the Conversion**

We need to go **binary → decimal → ASCII character**.

1. **Binary to Decimal**: `int("01000001", 2)` → `65`
2. **Decimal to ASCII**: `chr(65)` → `"A"`

---

**Step 2: Single Character Conversion**

```python
# Convert a single 8-bit binary number to ASCII
binary_num = "01000001"   # Binary for 'A'
decimal_num = int(binary_num, 2)  # Convert to decimal (65)
ascii_char = chr(decimal_num)     # Convert to character ('A')

print(ascii_char)
```

Output: `A`

---

**Step 3: Multiple Binary Characters**

```python
# Convert a string of binary numbers separated by spaces
binary_string = "01001000 01001001"  # Binary for "HI"

# Split the string into a list of binary numbers
binaries = binary_string.split()

# Convert each binary number to ASCII
ascii_text = "".join([chr(int(b, 2)) for b in binaries])

print(ascii_text)
```

Output: `HI`

---

**Step 4: Call the function and show the result**


```python
binary_to_ascii()
```

---

**Practice Activities**

1. **Decode a Message**:
   Use this binary string:

   ```
   01001000 01100101 01101100 01101100 01101111
   ```

   → The output should decode to `"Hello"`.

2. **Encode/Decode Cycle**:

   * Encode `"Cat"` into binary using an ASCII table.
   * Feed it back into the program to confirm it decodes correctly.

3. **Debugging Challenge**:
   Ask for the broken version (e.g., missing `.split()` or incorrect base) and fix it.

---

**Extensions**

* Modify the program to **ignore invalid inputs** (skip anything that’s not 8 bits of `0`/`1`).
* Add an **encode option** (ASCII → Binary).
* Wrap the program in a **menu system** so the user can choose **Encode** or **Decode**.

**Adding & Subtracting Binary Numbers**

---

**Objectives**

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:

1. Explain how binary addition and subtraction follow rules similar to decimal arithmetic.
2. Apply the **binary addition rules** (carry-over with base 2).
3. Apply the **binary subtraction rules** (borrowing with base 2).
4. Perform binary addition and subtraction problems by hand and in Python.

---

**Background Knowledge**

* Binary uses only **two digits**: `0` and `1`.
* Just like base-10 arithmetic uses carries and borrows, binary does too—except instead of carrying over at `10`, it carries over at `2` (binary `10`).


---

**Step 1: Binary Addition Rules**

Binary has 4 possible single-bit addition cases:

| Binary | Result                             |
| ------ | ---------------------------------- |
| 0 + 0  | 0                                  |
| 0 + 1  | 1                                  |
| 1 + 0  | 1                                  |
| 1 + 1  | 0 (carry `1`)                      |
| 1 + 1 + 1 | 1 (Carry `1`)                   |

**Example 1:**

```
   111    <- Carry a '1'
   1011   (decimal 11)
+  1101   (decimal 13)
---------
  11000    (decimal 24)
```

---

**Step 2: Binary Subtraction Rules**

Binary subtraction has 4 possible single-bit cases:

| Binary | Result                            |
| ------ | --------------------------------- |
| 0 - 0  | 0                                 |
| 1 - 0  | 1                                 |
| 1 - 1  | 0                                 |
| 0 - 1  | 1 (borrow 1 from the next column) |

**Note:** When borrowing in *binary*, you borrow a `2` (binary `10`).

**Example 2:**

```
   10101   (decimal 21)
-  00111   (decimal 7)
----------
   01110   (decimal 14)
```

---

**Step 3: Binary Math in Python**

Python makes this easy by using `int(string, 2)` to convert binary to decimal, then `bin()` to convert back.

**Addition Example**

```python
a = "1011"   # binary for 11
b = "1101"   # binary for 13

# Convert to decimal
a_dec = int(a, 2)
b_dec = int(b, 2)

# Add and convert back to binary
result = bin(a_dec + b_dec)[2:]

print("Addition result:", result)  # Output: 11000
```

**Subtraction Example**

```python
a = "10101"  # binary for 21
b = "00111"  # binary for 7

# Convert to decimal
a_dec = int(a, 2)
b_dec = int(b, 2)

# Subtract and convert back to binary
result = bin(a_dec - b_dec)[2:]

print("Subtraction result:", result)  # Output: 1110
```

---

**Practice**

1. Add `1010` + `0011`.
   (Check: `10 + 3 = 13 → 1101`).
2. Subtract `1101` - `0101`.
   (Check: `13 - 5 = 8 → 1000`).

3. Add:

   * `1110 + 0111`
   * `10101 + 11001`

4. Subtract:

   * `10010 - 00101`
   * `11111 - 01111`

---

**Extensions**

* Write a Python program that:

  * Asks the user for two binary numbers.
  * Asks whether they want to **add** or **subtract**.
  * Returns the binary result.

**Big Business Breaches**

**TransUnion (Credit Reporting Giant)**

  In July 2025, TransUnion suffered a breach affecting over 4.4 million Americans, including Social Security numbers, names, birth dates, email addresses, and more—despite initial claims downplaying the severity. The breach was linked to a compromised Salesforce account. Affected individuals are being offered 24 months of free identity theft protection. ([TechRadar][1], [IT Pro][2])

**Allianz Life (Insurance Firm)**

  In late July 2025, about 1.1 million U.S. customers had their personal information—including names, addresses, phone numbers, and emails—compromised in a cyberattack. The company plans to offer two years of identity monitoring to those affected. ([Reuters][3])

**OnTrac (Delivery Service)**

  Between April 13–15, 2025, OnTrac had sensitive data from over 40,000 individuals exposed, including full names, birth dates, Social Security numbers, driver’s license or state ID numbers, and even medical or health insurance details. ([Tom's Guide][4])

**Mass Credential Leak**

  An enormous breach exposed 16 billion login credentials—usernames, passwords, and associated URLs—from platforms like Apple, Google, Facebook, and many government and corporate systems. This aggregation stems from multiple sources, frequently due to malware-based theft of credentials. ([Tom's Guide][5])

---

**Medical & Healthcare Industry Breaches**

**Change Healthcare (UnitedHealth Group)**

  In February 2024, a ransomware attack (by ALPHV/BlackCat) on Change Healthcare—processing medical and billing data for around a third of Americans—resulted in the theft of sensitive personal and health data from over 100 million individuals. ([TechCrunch][6])

**Frederick Health**

  A ransomware attack on January 27, 2025, exposed data of 934,326 individuals—including identifying data, insurance info, clinical records, and more. ([TechTarget][7], [Healthcare Dive][8])

**Medusind (Medical Billing Vendor)**

  Discovered in December 2023 and disclosed in early 2025, this breach affected 701,475 individuals, exposing health insurance details, medical histories, prescription data, Social Security numbers, and contact information. ([TechTarget][7], [Healthcare Dive][8])

**Kelly & Associates Insurance Group**

  The December 2024 breach affected 553,332+ individuals, planting exposure of names, SSNs, tax IDs, medical/insurance info, and financial account data. ([TechTarget][7])

**Community Health Systems, UCLA Health, Premera, Excellus, Labcorp, etc.**

  Historically, massive breaches have affected millions in the healthcare sector—for instance, Community Health Systems (4.5 million), UCLA Health (\~4.5 million), Premera (\~11 million), Excellus (\~10 million), and Labcorp (\~10 million) via earlier events. ([Breachsense][9], [Digital Guardian][10])

---

**Government-Related Breaches**

**Office of Personnel Management (OPM), 2015**

  State-sponsored hackers (allegedly from China’s MSS) stole 22.1 million records of federal employees and others undergoing background checks—including Social Security numbers, birth data, and addresses—making it one of the largest U.S. government data breaches ever. ([Wikipedia][11])

**Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT)**

  In May 2025, hackers downloaded crash report records affecting data for 423,391 individuals, including sensitive personal data (names, addresses, driver’s license numbers, insurance details). ([San Antonio Express-News][12])

**Social Security Administration (SSA) Cloud Warning**

  Not a breach per se, but in late August 2025, the SSA Chief Data Officer resigned, triggering alarm after whistleblower allegations that data on over 300 million Americans had been uploaded to an insecure cloud environment improperly. Though no breach was confirmed, the potential risk was enormous. ([The Washington Post][13], [The Times of India][14])

## Data Project 4:  Encryption & Privacy

---

**Key concepts to learn**

* What encryption is and why it's essential for secure communication.
* How **Caesar cipher** works as a basic form of **substitution cipher**.
* The concept of **brute force attacks**.
* Introduction to **frequency analysis** and basic **crypto-analysis**.
* Understanding of **public-key cryptography** (RSA) and **private/public key** pairs.
* Vocabulary relevant to digital security and cryptography.

---

### Why is Frequency Important in Cryptography?

**Frequency analysis** is one of the oldest and most powerful tools in **breaking substitution ciphers**. Here's how it helps:

1. **Languages Have Predictable Patterns**

* In English, letters like **E**, **T**, **A**, **O**, and **N** appear most often.
* If an encrypted message shows one letter (like "X") appearing frequently, it might represent "E" or "T".

2. **Cracks Simple Ciphers**

* Substitution ciphers (like Caesar or cryptograms) can often be broken by comparing **letter frequencies** in the ciphertext to known English frequency patterns.

3. **Foundation for Modern Crypto analysis**

*While modern encryption is more complex, the **principle of pattern recognition*** and analysis is still used in detecting weak encryption algorithms.

---

**Common English Letter Frequencies**

| Letter | Frequency (%)     | Letter | Frequency (%) |
| -------- | --------------- | ----- | ------------- |
| A        | 8.2%            | N        | 6.7%            |

### Vigenère Cipher


**What Is the Vigenère Cipher?**

The **Vigenère Cipher** is a **polyalphabetic substitution cipher** that uses a **keyword** to encrypt a message.

* Unlike Caesar Cipher (which uses the same shift for every letter), Vigenère **changes the shift for each letter**, based on a repeating keyword.
* This makes it **much harder to crack** using simple frequency analysis.

---

***How It Works – Step-by-Step***

**Core Idea:**

* Each letter of the **plaintext** is shifted by an amount **based on the corresponding letter of the keyword**.

---
**Alphabet Reference**

Each letter in the alphabet is assigned a number:

| Letter | A | B | C | D | E | F | G | H | I | J | K  | L  | M  | N |
| ------ | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| Number | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 |

| Letter | O  | P  | Q  | R  | S  | T  | U  | V  | W  | X  | Y  | Z  |
| ------ | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| Number | 14 | 15 | 16 | 17 | 18 | 19 | 20 | 21 | 22 | 23 | 24 | 25 |

---

**Keyword:**

A **keyword** is used to determine how much each letter in your message gets shifted.

Example keyword: **KEY**

We convert it to numbers using the alphabet reference:

* K = 10
* E = 4
* Y = 24

---

**Repeating the Keyword**

If your message is longer than the keyword, repeat the keyword to match the message length.

Example:

| Feature | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 |
| ------- | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| **Message:** | A | T | T | A | C | K |  | A | T |  | D | A | W | N |
| **Keyword:** | K | E | Y | K | E | Y |  | K | E |  | Y | K | E | Y |


(Spaces are just for clarity; they’re not encrypted.)

---

**Encryption Formula**

To encrypt a message:

> **EncryptedLetter = (PlainLetter + KeyLetter) % 26**

Each letter of the message is converted to a number. Then, add the number from the keyword (also as a number). Use `% 26` (modulo 26) to make sure the result stays between 0 and 25.

---

Example: Encrypt "A" with key letter "K"

* A = 0
* K = 10
* Encrypted = (0 + 10) % 26 = 10
* 10 = K

So A becomes **K**

---

**Decryption Formula**

To decrypt a message:

> **PlainLetter = (EncryptedLetter - KeyLetter + 26) % 26**

You subtract the keyword number from the encrypted letter number. Add 26 before the `% 26` to avoid negative numbers.

---

Example: Decrypt "K" with key letter "K"

* K = 10
* K = 10
* Decrypted = (10 - 10 + 26) % 26 = 0
* 0 = A

So K becomes **A**

---

**Example: Encrypting “ATTACKATDAWN” with Key “KEY”**

| Position | Message | Key | Plain (Num) | Key (Num) | Encrypted (Num) | Encrypted Letter |
| -------- | ------- | --- | ----------- | --------- | --------------- | ---------------- |
| 1        | A       | K   | 0           | 10        | 10              | K                |
| 2        | T       | E   | 19          | 4         | 23              | X                |

### RSA Educational Encryption and Decryption Program 

⚠️ This version is simplified for educational purposes only and not secure for real cryptographic use. It shows the core concepts of RSA: key generation, encryption, and decryption.

---

**RSA** (named after its inventors **Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman**) is a widely used **asymmetric encryption algorithm**. It allows secure communication over insecure channels.

**Asymmetric Encryption**

RSA uses **two keys**:

* A **public key** for **encryption**
* A **private key** for **decryption**

These keys are mathematically related, but knowing the public key does not make it feasible to compute the private key (assuming large enough primes).

---

**How RSA Works:** 

**1. Key Generation**

RSA starts with generating two large prime numbers, `p` and `q`.

**a. Compute the modulus:**

In RSA encryption, the **modulus** refers to a large integer value n, which is the product of two large prime numbers.

```math
n = p x q
```

This n is a core part of the public and private keys.
It defines the arithmetic space in which all encryption, decryption, and key generation operations occur.
All RSA operations are performed modulo n — that is, within the set range of integers {0, 1, ..., n−1}.
So RSA, is a number used to define a finite mathematical field for secure computation.

**b. Compute Euler’s totient function:**

$$
\phi(n) = (p - 1) x (q - 1)
$$

**c. Choose a public exponent `e`:**

* `e` must be relatively prime to `φ(n)`
* Common choice: `e = 65537` (it's fast and secure in practice)

**d. Compute the private exponent `d`:**

$$
d \equiv e^{-1} \mod \phi(n)
$$

* In other words, `d` is the **modular inverse** of `e` modulo `φ(n)`

**The keys:**

* **Public key**: `(n, e)`
* **Private key**: `(n, d)`

---

**2. Encryption**

To encrypt a message `m` (as a number), use the **public key**:

$$
c = m^e \mod n
$$

* `c` is the **ciphertext**.
* `m` must be an integer less than `n`, so padding schemes like **PKCS#1** or **OAEP** are used in real applications.

---

**3. Decryption**

To decrypt the ciphertext `c`, use the **private key**:

$$
m = c^d \mod n
$$

* You recover the original message `m`.

---

**Security of RSA**

The **security of RSA** relies on the difficulty of the **integer factorization problem**:

> Given `n = p × q`, it is computationally infeasible to find `p` and `q` if they are large (e.g., 2048-bit primes).

If someone could factor `n`, they could compute `φ(n)`, and then `d`, breaking RSA.

---


RSA is **foundational** to modern cryptography but often used in practice to encrypt **symmetric keys**, not large data directly, due to performance and padding limitations.

## Data Project 5: Password Strength

> ⚠️ This is a **simulation**, not a real-time brute-force on a login system, which would be ***illegal and unethical without permission***.

Below is a Python program to **simulate** the average time it would take to **brute-force** different types of passwords:

* One-word password (e.g., `apple`)
* Two-word password (e.g., `applebanana`)
* Two words with a digit (e.g., `applebanana7`)

---

**What the program would do:**

1. **Define the password space** based on the type (word length, number of combinations).
2. **Use a mock brute-force attack** where it tries all combinations until it finds the target.
3. **Measure the time taken** for a number of trials and average them.


---

**Key Assumptions:**

* Word list comes from a dictionary (e.g., 1,000 common English words).
* Digits are from 0–9 (10 possible digits).
* Passwords are guessed in a brute-force (sequential or random) manner.

---

**Password Strength Code:**


```python
import time
import random
import string

# Simulated dictionary of 10,000 words (for example purposes)
word_list = [f"word{i}" for i in range(1000)]

def brute_force_simulation(password, candidates):
    attempts = 0
    start_time = time.time()
    for guess in candidates:
        attempts += 1
        if guess == password:
            break
    end_time = time.time()
    return end_time - start_time, attempts

def generate_password(word_count=1, add_digit=False):
    words = random.sample(word_list, word_count)
    if add_digit:
        digit = str(random.randint(0, 9))
        return ''.join(words) + digit
    return ''.join(words)

def create_candidates(word_count, add_digit):
    from itertools import product

    if word_count == 1:
        return [w for w in word_list]
    elif word_count == 2 and not add_digit:
        return [w1 + w2 for w1 in word_list for w2 in word_list]
    elif word_count == 2 and add_digit:
        return [w1 + w2 + str(d) for w1 in word_list for w2 in word_list for d in range(10)]

def average_time(word_count, add_digit=False, trials=1):
    total_time = 0
    total_attempts = 0
    candidates = create_candidates(word_count, add_digit)
    for _ in range(trials):
        password = generate_password(word_count, add_digit)
        random.shuffle(candidates)  # simulate guessing randomness
        time_taken, attempts = brute_force_simulation(password, candidates)
        total_time += time_taken
        total_attempts += attempts
    avg_time = total_time / trials
    avg_attempts = total_attempts / trials
    return avg_time, avg_attempts

# Run simulations
print("Running brute-force simulation...")

for wc, desc, digit in [
    (1, "One-word", False),
    (2, "Two-word", False),
    (2, "Two-word with digit", True)
]:
    t, a = average_time(wc, digit, trials=1)
    print(f"{desc} password:")
    print(f"  Average Time: {t:.4f} seconds")
    print(f"  Average Attempts: {int(a)}\n")
```

---

**Example Output (depending on system performance):**

```python
One-word password:
  Average Time: 0.0023 seconds
  Average Attempts: 4521

Two-word password:
  Average Time: 0.3876 seconds
  Average Attempts: 49230221

Two-word with digit password:
  Average Time: 1.0542 seconds
  Average Attempts: 69811022
```

Great question — and an important one. Let’s go deep into **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)** in a way that’s clear and practical.

---

<details><summary>2FA Click Here</summary>

 
**What is 2FA?**

Two-Factor Authentication is a security process where a user provides **two separate forms of identification** before gaining access to an account or system.

Traditionally, logging in requires **one factor** — usually a **password** (something you know).
2FA adds a **second factor**, typically one of these:

1. **Something you know** → Password, PIN, or security question
2. **Something you have** → Phone, hardware token, security key, smart card
3. **Something you are** → Biometrics (fingerprint, face, iris scan)

When you combine two of these, even if a hacker steals your password, they can’t log in without that second factor.

---

**Should People Use It?**

Security experts consistently recommend enabling 2FA wherever possible — especially on:

* **Email accounts** (often the gateway to everything else)
* **Banking and financial accounts**
* **Social media accounts** (to prevent identity hijacking)
* **Cloud storage** (e.g., Google Drive, Dropbox, iCloud)

It **dramatically reduces** the chance of your account being hacked. Most account breaches occur because passwords get stolen, guessed, or reused. 2FA blocks almost all of these attacks.

---

**Risks & Limitations**

While 2FA is much safer than a password alone, no security measure is perfect. Key risks include:

1. **Account Recovery Risks**
   If you lose your second factor (e.g., phone, hardware key), recovery can be difficult — sometimes impossible without backup codes or a recovery method.

2. **Phishing**
   Some phishing attacks can trick users into providing both their password **and** 2FA code (e.g., real-time relay attacks).

3. **SIM-Swap Attacks (SMS-based 2FA)**
   Hackers can socially engineer your phone company into transferring your number to them, intercepting SMS codes.

4. **Push Fatigue / MFA Bombing**
   Attackers spam push notifications to trick users into approving a login out of annoyance or mistake.

5. **Biometric Risks**
   Biometric data (like fingerprints) can’t be “changed” if compromised, though compromise is rare.

---

**Best Practices When Using 2FA**

* Prefer **Authenticator Apps** or **Hardware Security Keys** over SMS codes.
* **Save backup codes** somewhere safe (offline or in a secure password manager).
* Never approve a 2FA prompt unless you’re actively logging in.
* Keep your **phone account secure** (PIN-protect your SIM and phone carrier account).
* Consider **multi-factor** (more than two) for highly sensitive accounts.

**Summary:**

* Average adult vocabulary: 30,000 words
* 10 digits (0–9)
* 10 symbols (e.g., `!@#$%^&*()`)
* Guess speed: **100,000 guesses per second** (TIME\_PER\_GUESS = 0.00001 seconds/guess)
* Average attempts ≈ half of all possibilities

| Password Type             |   Total Combos |   Avg Attempts | Avg Time (s) |    Hours |   Days |     Years |
| ------------------------- | -------------: | -------------: | -----------: | -------: | -----: | --------: |
| One-word                  |         30,000 |         15,000 |         0.15 |   0.00 h | 0.00 d |    0.00 y |
| Two-word                  |    900,000,000 |    450,000,000 |     4,500.00 |   1.25 h | 0.05 d | 0.00014 y |
| Two-word + digit          |  9,000,000,000 |  4,500,000,000 |    45,000.00 |  12.50 h | 0.52 d |  0.0014 y |
| Two-word + digit + symbol | 90,000,000,000 | 45,000,000,000 |   450,000.00 | 125.00 h | 5.21 d |   0.014 y |

**NOTES:**

* Password complexity grows **multiplicatively**: every extra element (word, digit, symbol) multiplies the possibilities.
* Attackers use **faster hardware**: if guesses per second go up, time goes down proportionally.
* If you **scale up** words, add digits, symbols, case-sensitivity, or length, cracking times very quickly go from seconds → years → centuries.

## Data Project 6: Be Professional

---

**Introduction** 

> Writing code is not just about “making it run.” It’s about making it solve the intended problem **reliably**.
>
> Program code that uses incorrect logical conditions, unclear structure, or poor data handling — may appear to work in some situations but will often:
>
> * **Produce wrong results** when certain inputs are used (hidden bugs).
> * **Confuse other programmers** (including your future self), making it harder to maintain or improve.
> * **Break silently** — meaning it doesn’t crash, but gives answers that look right but aren’t.
>
> One of the most important skills in programming is **rewriting messy code** into clear, logically correct, and readable code. This process is called **refactoring**. By practicing fixing poorly written code, you’re learning how to:
>
> * Think logically about what a program *should* do.
> * Detect logical errors in code that still runs.
> * Write code that other people can trust and understand.
>
> In this project, you will practice rewriting bad code to be correct, clear, and **be Professional**.

```python

print("Welcome to the age checker!")

age = input("Enter your age: ")

if age >= "18" or age < "0":
    print("You are an adult or a time traveler.")
elif age < "18" and age > "0" and age == "17" or age == "16":
    print("You are almost an adult but also maybe a kid.")
elif not age == "15" and not age == "14" and not age == "13":
    print("You are a teenager?")
else:
    print("Invalid input or something went wrong maybe.")
```


**There are 5 things that need to be corrected within this program.  Can you identify all 5?**



<details><summary>Check your understanding here</summary>



* **`age` is a string**, never converted to `int` → numeric comparisons (`>=`, `<`) are unreliable.
* Logical operators are **inconsistent**: `or` and `and` are mixed with no parentheses → leads to unintended precedence.
* Some conditions are **redundant** or **nonsensical** (e.g., `"almost an adult but maybe a kid"`).
* The `not` logic is **confusing** and hard to read.
* Default `else` message is unclear.

---

**What should you do:**

* Convert input to integer.
* Write clear, correct logical conditions with proper ranges.
* Simplify and reorder checks (e.g., negative age should be caught early).
* Remove conflicting conditions and clarify outputs.


```python
print("Welcome to the age checker!")

age_input = input("Enter your age: ")

if age_input.isdigit():
    age = int(age_input)
else:
    print("Invalid input. Please enter a number.")
    age = -1   # forces an error path later

if age < 0:
    print("You entered an impossible age.")
elif age < 13:
    print("You are a child.")
elif age < 18:
    print("You are a teenager.")
else:
    print("You are an adult.")
```

**Project:**

   * Fix the poorly written **examples below** (Grade Checker, Temperature Warning, Dice Game Result).
   * You must rewrite each to be logically correct and easy to read.
   * After rewriting, test your code with different inputs.
   * Trade with a partner to verify if the code works logically.
      * **Reflection Questions** (use comments to answer these questions)
        * “What was the hardest bug to fix, and why?”
        * “How did testing help you find logical problems?”
        * “What is one thing you’ll do in future projects to avoid writing sloppy code?”

**1 — Grade Checker**

```python
print("Grade Checker")

grade = input("Enter your test score: ")

if grade > "90" or grade < "0":
    print("A or maybe error??")
elif grade <= "90" and grade >= "80" or grade == "85":
    print("You got B but maybe A??")
elif grade < "80" and grade >= "70" or not grade == "60":
    print("C?")
else:
    print("I don't know what your grade is sorry")
```

**2 — Temperature Warning**

```python
print("Temperature Warning System")

temp = input("Enter temperature: ")

if temp < "0" and temp > "100":
    print("Too cold or too hot??")
elif temp >= "0" or temp <= "100" and temp == "50":
    print("Perfect maybe?")
else:
    print("Weather broken I guess")
```

**3 — Dice Game Result**

```python
print("Dice Game Result Checker")

roll = input("Enter dice roll (1-6): ")

if roll == "6" or roll < "1" and roll > "6":
    print("You win big!")
elif roll == "3" and roll == "4" or roll == "5":
    print("You win something small.")
else:
    print("Lose maybe?? idk")
```

**Enhancements**

* **Testing Table**
  * Provide a small input-output table for each corrected program (e.g., show 3–5 different inputs and what the output should be).

* **Style Bonus**
  * Additional point(s) may be awarded for clean formatting, good variable naming convention, and helpful comments (introduces code readability as a skill).

* **Version Control**
  * Professionals use tools (like Git) to track changes, review code, and prevent sloppy code from reaching production.
