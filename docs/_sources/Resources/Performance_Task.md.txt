# Performance Task 

Here’s a 10-day calendar and checklist to help students successfully complete their performance task. This calendar outlines the process from initial planning to final testing and submission, encouraging a consistent, structured approach. I’ve also included updates to the requirements and a daily log format for students to document their progress.

  - **What I learned:** 
    - (e.g., "Built a more robust error-handling system.")

---

#### **Day 6: Adding Advanced Features / Enhancements**

- **Tasks:**
  - Add advanced features (e.g., error handling, extra functionality, design improvements).
  - Polish the UI/UX.

### **Performance Task Requirements Update:**

- **Performance Criteria:**
  - The program must have at least three main features.
  - The program must be error-free and user-friendly.
  - The program should include user interaction (e.g., input, buttons).
  - The code should be well-commented and organized.
  - Students are encouraged to use advanced programming techniques where possible.

- **Documentation:**
  - A brief report explaining the project, the development process, and challenges faced must be submitted alongside the code.

This calendar provides structure while allowing for creativity and problem-solving. It encourages students to log their daily development process, which helps them reflect on their progress and identify areas for improvement.
