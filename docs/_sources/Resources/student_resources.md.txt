## The Six Benefits of Documentation

[Link](https://cindyscheung.medium.com/pleeeeaase-explain-your-code-e1fdfdf19566 )

1. **Documentation quickly reminds the creator of what he did in the past**.

Have you ever reviewed a script that you coded months ago and forgot exactly what you did? Did you spend hours trying to figure it out again? I have. If the summaries and comments in the code were diligently and consistently kept, the review time should be significantly reduced.

2. **Documentation allows anyone who takes over the code to learn faster**.

In the same vein, anyone else who needs to take over the code would spend less time learning the code because documentation eases the learning curve. And the less time someone spends reviewing old code, the more time he can spend being productive in creating the new one.

3. **Documentation tracks what has been done to the code (i.e. versioning)**.

It doesn’t make any sense to me why I would find updated code with outdated comments within the same script.
Each programmer is responsible for updating both the code and comments at the same time. Each time a section of code is finished and working, the programmer ought to edit the comments and save the script as a new version. So I am NOT saying that the programmer must edit the comments while he is still trying to figure out the code. I am saying that once he is satisfied with his completed code, he should update his comments too. Not later. Immediately. By updating the code and comments in incremental versions, everyone can keep track of what had already been done before.

4. **Documentation helps those not as proficient at coding**.

Not everyone is a programmer. Many of us, like yours truly, may have coded before but would not consider ourselves expert programmers. And at some point, one of us will be required to at least study the scripts. Without comments or any project specific documentation, the best resource would be the people who developed the script.
But what if they no longer exist in the office? We end up resorting to general programming resources, then figure out how to implement the information to the actual project. This can be time-consuming and risks revealing company proprietary information when external people ask for specifics in order to provide a solution.

5. **Documentation helps technical people translate the code to business value**.

What about the people whose primary interest is the bottom line? Writing summaries for the code allows the programmer to see his work at a higher level. Rather than staying in the comfort of the nitty-gritty, programmers will have the chance to contemplate how his work fits into the bigger picture. As an engineer and a writer, I want to innovate and speak my mind. But all too often, technical people develop state-of-the-art products that have no value to the company or their customers. Groundbreaking products that do not fulfill a need will be rendered useless. Summarizing the code into laymen’s terms keeps the programmer from going off course. Explanations to business executives would be easier because the connection between the code and the customer need would be clearer.

6. **Documentation keeps a record of lessons learned**.
   
Proper project management includes discussions and documentation of lessons learned. This should not only apply to the team as a whole, but it also applies to individual contributors. In fact, a friend of mine keeps a lessons log for her personal life. Lessons learned does not only document things that should not be repeated. It also documents the things that CAN — and maybe should — be repeated. Taking the time to review the document at the beginning of the project could prevent repeating mistakes. I mean, isn’t it less excruciating to review lessons learned than staring at the code to find a bug that could have been prevented? But don’t wait until the end of the project to record the lessons. It is crucial to take responsibility and record them once they are recognized. Otherwise, they could be long forgotten. So if not immediately, at least by the end of the close of business.


In the end, it all boils down to this: Documentation builds empathy for future efforts. It is selfish and irresponsible to only think in the here-and-now and not consider new members who will take over the work or who need to translate it to the bottom line. By creating concise, meaningful documentation, future team members can be more productive and free to innovate. Be smart about it.

## SCRUM

Students should learn SCRUM because it is an essential tool that will teach them **collaboration, communication, and project management skills**. Project Management structures like SCRUM are highly valued in both academic and professional settings. SCRUM is a framework used in Agile development that emphasizes **teamwork, adaptability, and iterative progress**, making it ideal for preparing to work effectively in real-world, team-based environments.

**Key reasons why you should learn SCRUM**:

1. **Real-World Relevance**
   SCRUM is widely used in the tech industry and beyond. Learning it helps students understand how real software development teams plan, track, and deliver work.

2. **Team Collaboration**
   SCRUM teaches students how to work in teams, take on specific roles (like Scrum Master or Product Owner), and share responsibility for outcomes This is a crucial skill in any profession.

3. **Time and Task Management**
   Through sprints and daily stand-ups, students learn how to break down big tasks, prioritize them, and stay on track—skills that also improve personal productivity.

4. **Adaptability and Continuous Improvement**
   SCRUM encourages reflecting on what went well and what didn’t through retrospectives. This instills a growth mindset and improves learning from both success and failure.

5. **Clear Communication**
   Regular meetings and sprint reviews foster clarity, accountability, and structured feedback—all valuable in academics and careers.

6. **Ownership and Engagement**
   SCRUM empowers students to take ownership of their work, make decisions collaboratively, and stay engaged by seeing steady progress.

SCRUM is used to manage complex product development. Below is a breakdown of the SCRUM phases, along with documentation that should be created or maintained during each phase:

### 1. **Backlog (Product Backlog)**
   **What happens**: 
   - The **Product Owner** creates and manages the **Product Backlog**, which is a prioritized list of features, enhancements, bug fixes, or technical improvements that need to be done for the project. These items are usually called **Product Backlog Items (PBIs)**.
   - The team collaboratively refines the backlog, breaking larger tasks into smaller, actionable pieces.
   
   **Documentation**: 
   - **Product Backlog**: A list of all desired work items.
   - **Backlog Refinement Notes**: Any changes or additional information added during backlog grooming meetings.

### 2. **Sprint Planning**
   **What happens**: 
   - A **Sprint** is a time-boxed period, typically 1–4 weeks, where a specific set of work items from the backlog are worked on.
   - During **Sprint Planning**, the team selects high-priority backlog items to work on during the sprint. They break down these tasks into actionable steps.
   - The **Scrum Master** facilitates the session, ensuring the team has everything they need to succeed.

   **Documentation**: 
   - **Sprint Backlog**: The set of items from the product backlog that will be worked on during the sprint.
   - **Sprint Goal**: The objective the team aims to achieve during the sprint.
   - **Task Breakdown**: A detailed breakdown of the selected work items into smaller tasks.

### 3. **To-Do (Sprint Backlog)**
   **What happens**: 
   - The **To-Do** list is typically a section of the **Sprint Backlog** that contains tasks the team has planned to start but hasn't yet worked on. It provides visibility into upcoming tasks for the sprint.
   - These tasks are often broken down into smaller actionable items that are easy to track.

   **Documentation**:
   - **Sprint Backlog**: This document should list all tasks that have yet to be started during the sprint.
   - **Task Descriptions**: Clear descriptions of each individual task to avoid confusion.
  
### 4. **Doing (In Progress)**
   **What happens**: 
   - The team works on the tasks they selected during **Sprint Planning**. This is the "doing" phase, where active development occurs. Each task is moved from **To-Do** to **Doing** as work begins.
   - The team often has daily **Stand-up (Daily Scrum)** meetings to sync up on progress, address blockers, and adjust plans.

   **Documentation**: 
   - **Task Updates**: As work progresses, team members update task status, adding notes on progress, challenges, and next steps.
   - **Burndown Chart**: A visual representation of remaining work in the sprint, showing the team's progress.

### 5. **Review**
   **What happens**: 
   - At the end of the sprint, a **Sprint Review** meeting occurs where the team demonstrates the work completed during the sprint. This is done for the stakeholders, including the Product Owner.
   - The team discusses what went well, challenges faced, and what wasn’t completed.
   
   **Documentation**: 
   - **Sprint Review Notes**: A document or presentation summarizing the work completed, feedback from stakeholders, and any items that need to be adjusted.
   - **Completed Product Backlog Items**: Items that were completed during the sprint and can potentially be shipped or deployed.
   - **Release Notes** (optional): If the product is being released after the sprint, this includes updates and changes made during the sprint.

### 6. **Done (Sprint Retrospective)**
   **What happens**: 
   - The **Sprint Retrospective** is a meeting held after the Sprint Review, where the team reflects on the sprint itself. The focus is on **process improvement**—what worked well, what didn’t, and how things can be improved in future sprints.
   - The team agrees on actions to take in the next sprint to improve their processes and work together more effectively.
   
   **Documentation**: 
   - **Sprint Retrospective Notes**: Actionable items from the retrospective that are intended to improve the team's workflow.
   - **Action Items**: Specific improvements or adjustments the team will make in the next sprint.

### Overall SCRUM Documentation Considerations:
- **Product Backlog**: The entire product roadmap, which evolves throughout the project.
- **Sprint Backlog**: More focused on a particular sprint's work.
- **Burndown Chart**: Tracks work completion over time.
- **Sprint Review and Retrospective Notes**: Helps the team stay aligned and continuously improve their processes.
- **Definition of Done (DoD)**: The criteria that must be met for work to be considered "done," typically agreed upon by the team during the retrospective.

SCRUM emphasizes continuous inspection and adaptation, so while documentation exists, it is generally minimal and lightweight compared to traditional project management approaches. The focus is on delivering working software and having efficient communication rather than producing heavy documentation.


## SCRUM Master

The **Scrum Master** is a key role in the Scrum framework, responsible for ensuring that the Scrum process is being followed and facilitating the smooth functioning of the Scrum team. While the Scrum Master does not have authority over the team members, their primary focus is on enabling the team to be as effective as possible in delivering the product increment.

### Roles and Responsibilities of a Scrum Master:

#### 1. **Facilitator of Scrum Events:**
   - The Scrum Master is responsible for ensuring that Scrum ceremonies (also called events) are effectively planned, organized, and conducted. These include:
     - **Sprint Planning**: Helping the team define the goals and scope for the sprint.
     - **Daily Standups (Daily Scrum)**: Ensuring these daily meetings are brief, focused, and effective.
     - **Sprint Review**: Ensuring the team demonstrates the work done during the sprint to stakeholders and gathers feedback.
     - **Sprint Retrospective**: Facilitating discussions on what went well, what could be improved, and how the team can improve in the next sprint.

#### 2. **Removing Impediments:**
   - One of the key responsibilities of the Scrum Master is to identify and remove any obstacles (also called impediments) that are preventing the team from achieving their goals. These can be external (e.g., organizational barriers, technical issues) or internal (e.g., team dynamics or communication problems).

#### 3. **Shielding the Team:**
   - The Scrum Master protects the team from external disruptions, distractions, and interferences. For example, they might shield the team from unnecessary meetings or requests from stakeholders that can disrupt the team's focus.

#### 4. **Coach and Mentor:**
   - The Scrum Master helps the team understand and apply Scrum principles, practices, and values. They are responsible for fostering a culture of continuous improvement, helping team members improve their skills, and guiding them in becoming more self-organizing.
   - The Scrum Master might also help the Product Owner understand the Scrum process and how to work effectively with the team.

#### 5. **Promoting Collaboration and Communication:**
   - Scrum Masters encourage open communication and collaboration among team members and between the team and stakeholders. This includes fostering a positive, transparent, and respectful environment for both technical and non-technical discussions.
   - They also help facilitate better relationships between the Development Team, Product Owner, and other stakeholders.

#### 6. **Ensuring Adherence to Scrum Practices:**
   - The Scrum Master helps ensure that Scrum practices are being followed properly. While they don’t directly manage the team, they provide guidance to the team on how to implement Scrum principles and how to maintain focus on the team’s goals.

#### 7. **Continuous Improvement (Kaizen):**
   - Scrum Masters facilitate continuous improvement by encouraging team members to reflect and learn from each sprint. This is primarily done in Sprint Retrospectives but should also be part of the team's daily mindset. They encourage experimentation and help the team adopt practices that improve performance and delivery.

#### 8. **Helping the Product Owner:**
   - The Scrum Master assists the Product Owner in managing the product backlog by ensuring that it is well-formed, prioritized, and understood by the team. They help the Product Owner understand how to manage stakeholders' expectations and assist with refining the backlog when necessary.

#### 9. **Building Self-Organizing Teams:**
   - The Scrum Master works to build a self-organizing and high-performing team. This means fostering a culture where team members collaborate, solve problems together, and take responsibility for their work without micromanagement.

#### 10. **Promoting Transparency:**
   - Transparency is one of the pillars of Scrum. The Scrum Master helps ensure that the team’s progress, work, and obstacles are visible to everyone involved. They use tools like Scrum boards, burn-down charts, and sprint reviews to facilitate this transparency.

#### 11. **Facilitating Cross-Functional Team Collaboration:**
   - A Scrum team is cross-functional, meaning the team members possess various skills that allow them to complete work without relying heavily on other teams or departments. The Scrum Master encourages collaboration and coordination within the team and ensures that team members have the resources and support they need to perform their tasks.
