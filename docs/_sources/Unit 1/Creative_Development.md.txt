# Creative Development

The **Creative Development** section of the AP Computer Science Principles (CSP) course focuses on helping students develop skills in programming and computational thinking to create their own digital artifacts (such as apps, games, simulations, websites, or animations). This section emphasizes creativity, problem-solving, and iteration in the development process. It helps students build their programming skills while also learning how to design and refine computational solutions to problems.

### What You Will Learn:
1. **Problem Identification**: Students will learn how to define problems that can be solved through computing. This includes thinking critically about the needs of users or audiences and determining the appropriate computing tools or techniques to address the issue.
   
2. **Design and Development**: Students will learn how to break down a problem into smaller components and design a solution using algorithms, data structures, and other programming concepts. This section often involves developing a clear plan or outline before starting to write code.

3. **Implementation**: Students will learn how to translate their designs into functioning programs using a programming language. This will include writing and debugging code, as well as using existing software libraries or frameworks to enhance their projects.

4. **Iterative Improvement**: Students will learn how to test their programs and refine them based on feedback and new ideas. This can involve improving the usability, functionality, or efficiency of their work.

5. **Creativity and Expression**: The course emphasizes how students can use computing as a medium for personal expression and creativity. This could be through digital art, interactive media, or other projects that allow them to express ideas and solutions in unique ways.

### What You Will Do:
1. **Create a Digital Artifact**: Students will work on a substantial project that demonstrates their ability to apply programming concepts creatively. This could be anything from a game, animation, app, or simulation to a website, depending on the project requirements they choose.

2. **Use a Programming Language**: They will implement their projects using a programming language such as Python, JavaScript, or others, depending on the project type and the tools they are working with.

3. **Collaborate and Share Ideas**: Often, students will have opportunities to share their progress and ideas with peers, providing feedback and learning from each otherâ€™s approaches.

4. **Document the Development Process**: Students will keep track of their progress through documentation, explaining their design choices, challenges faced, and how they overcame them.

### How You Will Show What You Have Learned:
1. **Performance Tasks**: The Creative Development section includes a performance task that is submitted to the College Board. Students need to provide:
   - **Artifact**: A functioning digital product (app, game, simulation, etc.) that they have created.
   - **Written Responses**: Students write a reflection about their project, discussing their problem-solving approach, design decisions, and how they iterated on the project. This will include insights into the algorithms they implemented and the challenges they faced.

2. **Demonstration of Computational Thinking**: Students must demonstrate that they can use computational thinking (breaking down problems into smaller parts, designing solutions, and evaluating results) as part of their project.

3. **Self-Reflection**: Students will reflect on their learning, providing insight into how they created their digital artifact and what they learned through the process.
