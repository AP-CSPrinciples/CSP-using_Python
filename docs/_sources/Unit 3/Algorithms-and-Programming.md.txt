**3.4: Developing Procedures**

* Decomposing problems into subproblems
* Sequencing instructions
* Identifying reusable logic
* **Key Skill:** Create modular and readable code using procedures

**3.5: Algorithms**

* Understanding algorithms as step-by-step processes
* Expressing algorithms in code, pseudocode, or flowcharts
* Identifying sequence, selection, and iteration
* **Key Skill:** Analyze and write simple algorithms (e.g., search, sort)

**3.6: Boolean Expressions and If Statements**

* Using `if`, `else if`, and `else`
* Relational operators (`==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`)
* Logical operators (`AND`, `OR`, `NOT`)
* **Key Skill:** Write conditional logic to control program flow

**3.7: Iteration (Loops)**

* `for` loops and `while` loops
* Loop control: incrementing, breaking, and nested loops
* Trace and debug loop execution
* **Key Skill:** Use loops to automate repeated tasks

**3.8: Combining Elements to Solve Problems**

* Integrating variables, conditionals, and loops
* Building algorithms to solve complex problems
* Emphasis on testing and debugging
* **Key Skill:** Synthesize programming elements into working solutions

**3.9: Developing Algorithms**

* Using existing algorithms or creating new ones
* Refining and testing algorithms
* Representing algorithms as pseudocode and/or diagrams
* **Key Skill:** Plan, document, and implement multi-step logic

**3.10: Errors and Testing**

* Types of errors: syntax, logic, and runtime
* Use of test cases and debugging strategies
* Reading error messages and tracebacks
* **Key Skill:** Find and fix problems systematically

**3.11: Binary Search vs Linear Search**

* Linear search: simple, but slower for large data
* Binary search: faster, requires sorted data
* Tradeoffs in algorithm efficiency
* **Key Skill:** Compare search algorithms conceptually and in code

**3.12: Comparing Algorithmic Efficiency**

* Number of steps vs size of input (n)
* Informal analysis of algorithm runtime
* Big picture: efficiency impacts user experience and scalability
* **Key Skill:** Evaluate which algorithm is “better” and why

**3.13: Developing Programs**

* Problem identification, solution design
* Iterative development process: test, debug, refine
* Use of documentation and comments
* Collaboration and code review
* **Key Skill:** Design and build real programs with purpose

**Key Vocabulary**:

* Algorithm
* Abstraction
* Procedure
* Loop / Iteration
* Boolean
* Conditionals
* Debugging
* Linear/Binary Search
* Efficiency
* Input/Output
* Parameters / Return

**Suggested Activities:**

* **Debugging challenges**
