# Computer Science Principles



Computer science involves problem-solving, hardware, and algorithms that help people utilize computers and incorporate multiple perspectives
to address real-world problems in contemporary life. As the application of computer science is integrated into more aspects of our lives, it is important to understand the impact of computer science and how to maintain privacy, safety, and security not only when using computers but also while being the innovators of new computing applications. The course strives to engage all students, including those who have traditionally been underrepresented in computer science—such as female students, students of color, students with disabilities, and rural students—by allowing them to discover the power of computer science through rewarding yet challenging concepts.

AP Computer Science Principles introduces students to the breadth of the field of computer science. In this course, students will learn to design and evaluate solutions and to apply computer science to solve problems through the development of algorithms and programs.  They will incorporate abstraction into programs and use data to discover new knowledge.  Students will also explain how computing innovations and computing systems, including the Internet, work, explore their potential impacts, and contribute to a computing culture that is collaborative and ethical. It is important to note that the AP Computer Science Principles course does not have a designated programminglanguage.  Teachers have the flexibility to choose a programming language(s) that is most appropriate for their students to use in
the classroom

The main goals of an introductory college-level computer science course:
- Computational Solution Design—Design and evaluate computational solutions for a purpose.
- Algorithms and Program Development—Develop and implement algorithms.
- Abstraction in Program Development—Develop programs that incorporate abstractions.
- Code Analysis—Evaluateandtestalgorithmsand programs.
- Computing Innovations—Investigatecomputing innovations.
- Responsible Computing—Contributetoan inclusive, safe, collaborative, and ethical computing

| Term  | Definition |
| :---: | :--- |
| a ← expression	| Evaluates expression and then assigns a copy of the result to the variable a. |
| DISPLAY(expression)	| Displays the value of expression, followed by a space. |
| INPUT() | Accepts a value from the user and returns the input value. |
| a + b, a - b, a * b, a / b	| The arithmetic operators +, -, *, and / are used to perform arithmetic on a and b. For example, 17 / 5 evaluates to 3.4. The order of operations used in mathematics applies when evaluating expressions.  | 
| a MOD b | Evaluates to the remainder when a is divided by b. Assume that a is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and b is an integergreater than 0. For example, 17 MOD 5 evaluates to 2. The MOD operator has the same precedence as the * and / operators. | 
| RANDOM(a, b)	 | Generates and returns a random integer from a to b, including a and b. Each result is equally likely to occur. For example, RANDOM(1, 3) could return 1, 2, or 3. | 
|a = b, a ≠ b, a > b, a < b, a ≥ b, a ≤ b	 | The relational operators =, ≠, >, <, ≥, and ≤ are used to test the relationship between two variables, expressions, or values. A comparison using relational operators evaluates to a Boolean value. For example, a = b evaluates to true if a and b are equal; otherwise it evaluates to false.| 
|NOT condition	| Evaluates to true if condition is false; otherwise evaluates to false. | 
|condition1 AND condition2	 | Evaluates to true if both condition1 and condition2 are true; otherwise evaluates to false. | 
|condition1 OR condition2 | Evaluates to true if condition1 is true or if condition2 is true or if both condition1 and condition2 are true; otherwise evaluates to false. | 
|aList ← [value1, value2, value3, ...]	 | Creates a new list that contains the values value1, value2,value3, and ... at indices 1, 2, 3, and ... respectively and assigns it to aList. |
| aList ← []	| Creates an empty list and assigns it to aList. | 
 | aList ← bList	 |Assigns a copy of the list bList to the list aList. For example, if bList contains [20, 40, 60], then aList will also contain [20, 40, 60] after the assignment. | 
 | aList[i]	 | Accesses the element of aList at index i. The first element of aList is at index 1 and is accessed using the notation aList[1]. | 
 | x ← aList[i]	 | Assigns the value of aList[i] to the variable x.  | 
 | aList[i] ← x	 | Assigns the value of x to aList[i]. | 
 | aList[i] ← aList[j]	 | Assigns the value of aList[j] to aList[i]. | 
 | INSERT(aList, i, value)	 | Any values in aList at indices greater than or equal to i are shifted one position to the right. The length of the list is increased by 1, and value is placed at index i in aList.  | 
 | APPEND(aList, value)	 | The length of aList is increased by 1, and value is placed at the end of aList.  | 
 | REMOVE(aList, i)	 | Removes the item at index i in aList and shifts to the left any values at indices greater than i. The length of aList is decreased by 1. |

## Academic Integrity
<details><summary>Click to Open</summary>
<p>
This is a reminder that each student is responsible for their own work.  Assignments that are designated as team/ group assignments must have each students name within the block header.  Other assignments students may collaborate with another student, but each student must submit their own work and the assignment cannot be a facsimile of their peers work.  Submitted assignments that has another student's name on it and not your name will be considered as cheating and subject to the district/ schools policy regarding plagiarism/ cheating.
 
If you have any questions, please contact me.
